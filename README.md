The multi-tier application has been the most used architecture pattern for decades. The multi-tier pattern provides good guidelines for you to follow to ensure decoupled and scalable application components that can be separately managed and maintained.

## The Serverless Logic Tier
The logic tier of the three-tier architecture represents the brains of the application. Integrating API Gateway and functions to form your logic tier can be so revolutionary.
The features of the two services allow you to build a serverless production application that is highly available, scalable, and secure. Your application could use thousands of servers, however by leveraging this pattern you do not have to manage even a single one. 

In addition, by using these managed services together you gain the following benefits: 
*	No operating systems to choose, secure, patch, or manage.
*	No servers to right size, monitor, or scale out. 
*	No risk to your cost by over-provisioning. 
*	No risk to your performance by under-provisioning.
